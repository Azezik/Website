# You're {extraordinary} – Personal Application Page

A minimal site that mimics the look/feel of Shopify’s “You’re extraordinary” page.

## Deploy (Render)
1. Push these files to a public GitHub repo.
2. In Render, **New → Static Site**.
3. Connect the repo and deploy. No build command needed (static). 
4. Publish: you'll get `https://<app>.onrender.com`.

## Optional
- Point a custom domain for extra polish.
- Wire the `<form>` to Formspree/Netlify or a tiny backend if you want actual submissions.

## Customize
- Edit text in `index.html` (hero copy, labels, options).
- Adjust colors in `styles.css` (see CSS variables at the top).
