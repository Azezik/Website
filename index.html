    <h2>So why am I extraordinary?</h2>
    <p>I’m the type of person who will do whatever it takes to climb to the top and win. I could have just sent in my resume, but instead I built this website from scratch.</p>
    <p>While I’ve loved and used computers since before I could walk, I’d never written a line of code. When I went to your careers page, I saw two options: one to skip the line if you’re extraordinary and one that implied I wasn’t. So, I taught myself the basics of AI HTML coding using Codex, GitHub repos, Pages, and how to bring this site to life to prove my point.</p>
    <p>Do I believe I’m extraordinary? I believe I can be. Am I impressed with myself for making this website? No. But I’m proud to be the type of person who sees going above and beyond as the standard. That’s exactly the energy I’ll bring to Shopify.</p>
    <p>My resume is available further down the page. Below, you’ll find a few quick points to further hook you into thinking I’m an exceptional candidate:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ranked in the top &lt;5% worldwide as a Super-Recogniser – scored exceptionally superior on advanced face recognition tests led by Professor Josh P. Davis (University of Greenwich). (Fewer than 5% of all participants qualify for this advanced stage)
        <ul>
          <li>Cambridge Face Memory Test (Extended): 98/102</li>
          <li>Glasgow Face Matching Test: 39/40</li>
          <li>Short-Term Face Memory Test: 55/60</li>
          <li>Short-Term Face Memory Test: 55/60</li>
           </ul>
        </li> While my Super‑Recogniser ability qualifies me as a Wildcard entry, my real differentiator is the rare mix of sales execution, leadership, and firsthand experience embedded in the world of the customers you want to reach. I’ve spent years living in their world—understanding their needs, language, and pain points—so that when it comes to growth, I can move with the insight of an insider and the precision of an operator.</li>
        </ul>
    
      <li>Placed first out of all salespeople across 41 Club Piscine locations in the 2023 Jacuzzi Fall Sales Competition – and as Jacuzzi’s largest North American dealer at the time, this effectively put me at the top of the continent’s largest distribution network. Our location also sold the most tubs of all 41 locations that year, and we’ve consistently maintained that same top-tier performance since, contributing to $7.5M+ in lifetime sales with an average sale of $13,000.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Led operations for two of Ottawa’s busiest municipal beaches as one of only 8 Site Supervisors citywide – managed a team of up to 10 staff, coordinated public safety for hundreds of visitors daily, and made high-stakes decisions during emergencies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please also take the time to explore the Portfolio tab. It includes product concepts I’ve developed and refined to showcase my strategic thinking and approach to problem-solving. I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished here and in the resume below, but it’s what we could achieve together in the future, whether it’s those ideas or new ones, that excites me most.</p>
